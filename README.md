## Setup

### Home

> [!NOTE]
> Be around to enter password during initial `apt update` and changing of shells.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leelhn2345/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles/scripts
source setup_home.sh
```

afterwards, to log in into github

```sh
gh auth login
```

### Devpod

To create [all new workspaces with the same customization](https://devpod.sh/docs/developing-in-workspaces/dotfiles-in-a-workspace#for-all-workspaces):

```sh
# script is for `image: mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:debian`
devpod context set-options \
-o DOTFILES_URL=https://github.com/leelhn2345/dotfiles -o DOTFILES_SCRIPT=scripts/setup_devpod.sh
```

Once workspace is setup, ssh into pod and then customize [p10k theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
via prompt.

#### Overriding devcontainer image

To override the image configured in workspace's `devcontainer.json`, setup workspace
with `--devcontainer-image <image>` flag:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Repository must contain `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`!

```sh
# using debian base img
devpod up <workspace-git-url> --ide none --devcontainer-image mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:debian
```
